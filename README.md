# Requirements:

- Only those that have a status of "available" are currently able to be downloaded. Your implementation should manage this.
- The select-all checkbox should be in an unselected state if no items are selected.
- The select-all checkbox should be in a selected state if all items are selected.
- The select-all checkbox should be in an indeterminate state if some but not all items are selected.
- The "Selected 2" text should reflect the count of selected items and display "None Selected" when there are none selected.
- Clicking the select-all checkbox should select all items if none or some are selected.
- Clicking the select-all checkbox should de-select all items if all are currently selected.
- Status should be correctly formatted
- Clicking "Download Selected" when some or all items are displayed should generate an alert box with the path and device of all selected files.
- Precise/exact HTML formatting/styling to match the mockup is not required however rows should change colour when selected and on hover.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
